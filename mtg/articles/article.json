	"I remember my first booster I bought and opened. As a teenager, I went on trip and was robbed, while asleep in a train. All I had left was a ticket and one banknote in my pocket. To lift my spirits I decided to spend it on something fun. There wasn't anything too splashy and I don't remember playing with any of the cards I opened then: #card(23054), #card(23091), #card(23178), #card(22941). Nevertheless I was pretty excited and it did a good job cheering me up.",
	"Tried #card(413760) in my #card(442194) deck. Combined with #card(439738) it was enough to win on the same turn it was cast from an almost empty board. While it provided an interesting puzzle for the piloting player, it wasn't very interactive nor particularly exciting once mana became abundant. I don't think it provides enough replayability value to be included in the deck.",
	"#card(27169) is pretty time-consuming. The reward is mediocre as basic lands match in two cases. However, after casting it three times in one game, I'm sure this card is all about the unique mind-bending wording and having fun seeing your opponent hunting dregs from your library.",
