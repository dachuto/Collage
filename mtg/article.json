	"I remember my first booster I bought and opened. As a teenager, I went on trip and was robbed, while asleep in a train. All I had left was a ticket and one banknote in my pocket. To lift my spirits I decided to spend it on something fun. There wasn't anything too splashy and I don't remember playing with any of the cards I opened then: #card(23054), #card(23091), #card(23178), #card(22941). Nevertheless I was pretty excited and it did a good job cheering me up.",
